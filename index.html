<div class = "text">About Purranormal: NM Class 438 Group Project 1 - 'Zine. This project/ 'Zine was made by Anitra Griffin, Natalie Melech, Kat Patillo, and Duncan Trent. The idea to name this CLASS project Paranormal Activity came from our discussions around our original basis of our 'Zine. The first thought was to do ghost stories, paranormal/ haunting tales in the Western Carolina Area, specifically Asheville if we could find them. However, it was hard to find stories of any ghosts or hauntings that did not require us going to an inperson tour and with the short time span of our project and COVID-19 we decided against that idea. From there we thought of something close enough to ghosts and hauntings...Paranormal Activity and its history. We did not want to do just have the ghost stories and histories, we wanted something our readers could connect to, a mascot, so Kat mentioned their adorable black cat, Scamp. With our new mascot being a loveable graphic drawn by our team of Scamp, we decided our name should reflect our change and have some "cat" appeal. After bouncing around names and ideas Kat mentioned Purranormal Activity, a play on the words paranormal and the purring action cats do.Thus Purranormal Activity: The Meowning was born.</div>

  Hello, and welcome to the world of the <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red"> purranormal</span>. My name is <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">Scamp</span>, and I will be your guide in this adventure through the times and places belonging to the cats of the supernatural realm. Cats have always been rather <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">mysterious creatures</span>. Humans long ago took us into their homes and worshipped us as gods. Many cultures have ascribed <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">strange magics</span> to us, especially handsome black furred felines such as I. Now, if you dare to continue along with me on this path, I will take you to meet some of my friends and let them describe their abilities and history to you. You will need your <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">courage</span> when you…

<span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">  ENTER </span>

Greetings,<span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;"> Bakeneko </span>! It is nice to see you again. Why don’t you tell my guests a little bit about yourself?



&nbsp;
Only for you, Scamp. You know I don’t care for humans. My kind is that of a housecat that has transformed into a <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">yōkai</span>, a class of supernatural monsters from Japanese culture. We can transform in one of two ways. Either we are attracted to and drink enough of the lamp oil that humans used to use, which contained fish oil, or we simply live long enough to transform.

There’s another kind of cat <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">yōkai </span> from Japanese lore, though, right? Could you tell me how you differ?


You speak of the  <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">nekomata </span>. True, we tend to be very similar, and many believe that a <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">nekomata</span> is simply an older and more powerful <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">bakeneko </span>. However, one can easily tell the difference between us when looking at our <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">tails </span>. Bakeneko have a single long tail, while a nekomata’s tail has split into two.


Then you can very clearly be told apart. A cat’s tail is quite important, after all.

This is true, and part of the reason I revile humans. You see, our tail growing long was thought to aid in the transformation to a <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">bakaneko </span>, so superstitious humans would <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">cut them short </span>when we were young. This is why bobtail cats are so common in Japan. Additionally, many years ago, humans would designate a time period they would allow us to live and then kill us after this period so we wouldn’t grow old enough to transform. They believed we would haunt and kill them after we changed, though many times it has simply been revenge for poor treatment.


Some humans can be quite awful. I’m sorry for your kind’s loss. Would you like to talk about kinder humans?

Of course. While the  <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">nekomata </span> is always  <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;"> malevolent</span> in folklore, we bakeneko can be quite kind when not offended. There are many tales of us coming back to repay the humans who took us in and loved us. Additionally, one of the symbols of Japan, the <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">maneki-neko </span> that can be seen waving from many shops, is a
<span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;"> bakeneko </span>. The  <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">maneki-neko </span> brings luck, and depending on the posture and fur color can bring many types of <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">fortune </span>, though the most common is supposed to bring in customers.

How fancy of you! If simple statues of you can bring luck, what other mystical powers do you have?

Ah, yes. My kind has many abilities. We can shapeshift, generally into humans, speak the human tongue, stand on our hind legs, curse people, raise the dead, and even control fire. Of course, not all of us have all these abilities, but they all exist in the  <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">bakeneko </span>bakeneko kind.


Hey, is it true that when you guys shapeshift into humans, you get so happy you put a napkin on your head and dance?

<span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">
I think we’re done here.

Scamp: Okay humans, time to move onto <span style="font-family:Creepster; color: red;">ICELAND </span>
