# PurranormalActivity
NM Class 438 Group Project 1 - 'Zine.
This project/ 'Zine was made by Anitra Griffin, Natalie Melech, Kat Patillo, and Duncan Trent.

The idea to name this CLASS project Paranormal Activity came from our discussions around our original basis of our 'Zine. The first thought was to do ghost stories, paranormal/ haunting tales in the Western Carolina Area, specifically Asheville if we could find them. However, it was hard to find stories of any ghosts or hauntings that did not require us going to an inperson tour and with the short time span of our project and COVID-19 we decided against that idea. From there we thought of something close enough to ghosts and hauntings...Paranormal Activity and its history. We did not want to do just have the ghost stories and histories, we wanted something our readers could connect to, a mascot, so Kat mentioned her adorable black cat, Scamp. With our new mascot being a loveable graphic drawn by our team of Scamp, we decided our name should reflect our change and have some "cat" appeal. After bouncing around names and ideas Kat mentioned Purranormal Activity, a play on the words paranormal and the purring action cats do. 

Thus Purranormal Activity: The Meowning was born.
